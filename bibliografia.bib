abstract = "This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting and characterizing potholes and bumps directly from noisy signals acquired using an Accelerometer. A wavelet transformation based filter was used to decompose the signals into multiple scales. These coefficients were correlated across adjacent scales and filtered using a spatial filter. Road anomalies were then detected based on a fixed threshold system, while characterization was achieved using unique features extracted from the filtered wavelet coefficients. Our analyses show that the proposed algorithm detects and characterizes road anomalies with high levels of accuracy, precision and low false alarm rates."

abstract = "A wheeled ground robot was designed and built for better understanding of the challenges involved in utilization of accelerometer-based intelligent tires for mobility improvements. Since robot traction forces depend on the surface type and the friction associated with the tire-road interaction, the measured acceleration signals were used for terrain classification and surface characterization. To accomplish this, the robot was instrumented with appropriate sensors (a tri-axial accelerometer attached to the tire innerliner, a single axis accelerometer attached to the robot chassis and wheel speed sensors) and a data acquisition system. Wheel slip was measured accurately using encoders attached to driven and non-driven wheels. A fuzzy logic algorithm was developed and used for terrain classification. This algorithm uses the power of the acceleration signal and wheel slip ratio as inputs and classifies all different surfaces into four main categories; asphalt, concrete, grass, and sand. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using experimental data and good agreements were observed between the surface types and estimated ones."

abstract = "We determined the tyre contact length on dry and wet roads by measuring the accelerations of the inner liner with a three-axial accelerometer. The influence of the tyre pressure, driving velocity, and tread depth on the contact length was studied in both types of road surface conditions. On dry asphalt the contact length was almost constant, regardless of the driving velocity. On wet asphalt the presence of water could be detected even at low driving velocities (e.g. 20km/h for a worn tyre) as the contact length began to decrease from that found in the dry asphalt situation. In addition to improving the performance of active safety systems and driver warning systems, the contact length information could be beneficial for classifying and studying the aquaplaning behaviour of tyres."

In addition to layer thickness information, the pavement roughness was also verified using 3D accelerometer technique and IRI parameters were calculated and analyzed. This presentation summarizes the technology and results of a project where a special section of highway R2 Žiar nad Hronom bypass in the length of 5.2km was selected for the non-destructive testing. The processing and interpretation consists of extensive data sets presented as longitudinal profiles from survey of each lane of road. The designed layer thicknesses of the road were then compared with measured thickness data. In addition, a comprehensive presentation of the results in GIS view was produced to ensure the subsequent decision-making process easy to execute."

abstract = "Surface distress degrades not only structural but also functional performance of a pavement. In today’s socio-economic situations, as pavement infrastructures have aged, road agencies are obliged to monitor their pavements to locate unacceptable and severe surface distress for the welfare of road users. The objective of this study is to develop a method by use of an accelerometer-based mobile profilometer (MPM) for identifying the location and severity of pavement distress especially in urban areas. For the purpose of this study, we introduce the lifting wavelet transform (LWT) that enables us to develop customized lifting wavelet filters to detect desirable waveform characteristics in roughness profile data. This study proposes and demonstrates the application of lifting wavelet filters to detect the transverse cracks in an urban road pavement as a case study. According to the result, the proposed method automatically emphasizes the locations of particular cracks related to the pavement ride quality, which is sometimes difficult or impossible to discriminate the spectral characteristics by visual inspections. The findings of this paper prove that the LWT can be a powerful tool for surface monitoring activities."

abstract = "The main purpose of this work is to develop a low-cost data acquisition platform prototype for automotive telemetry applications such as driving style analysis, fleet management and fault detection. Measurement data, gathered from On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), are logged on the onboard device for remote backup. An accurate analysis of the collected data has been performed to identify the main parameters able to monitor driver behavior and to define suitable indexes to evaluate the driving performance. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of vehicle parameters during braking and gear shifting in order to classify different attitudes and generate driver profiles and trends. Understanding drivers’ characteristic behavior can contribute significantly to road safety, to define insurance premium, to engage user in saving fuel and money and to correlate faults of the car with the driving style."

abstract = "Monitoring and evaluating of driving behavior is the main goal of this paper that encourage us to develop a new system based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors of smartphones. In this system, a hybrid of Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used to recognize overall driving behaviors. The behaviors are classified into the safe, the semi-aggressive, and the aggressive classes that are adopted with Driver Anger Scale (DAS) self-reported questionnaire results. The proposed system extracts four features from IMU sensors in the forms of time series. They are decomposed by DWT in two levels and their energies are sent to six ANFISs. Each ANFIS models the different perception about driving behavior under uncertain knowledge and returns the similarity or dissimilarity between driving behaviors. The results of these six ANFISs are combined by three different decision fusion approaches. Results show that Coiflet-2 is the most suitable mother wavelet for driving behavior analysis. In addition, the proposed system recognizes the overall driving behavior patterns with 92 accuracy without necessity to evaluate the maneuvers one by one. We show that without longitude acceleration data, the driver behavior cannot be recognized successfully while the results do not disturb substantially when the gyroscope is not available."

abstract = "The present work investigates the use of smartphones as an alternative to gather data for driving behavior analysis. The proposed approach incorporates i. a device reorientation algorithm, which leverages gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS information, to correct the raw accelerometer data, and ii. a machine-learning framework based on rough set theory to identify rules and detect critical patterns solely based on the corrected accelerometer data. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of driving experiments are conducted in both controlled and “free-driving” conditions. In all experiments, the smartphone can be freely positioned inside the subject vehicle. Findings indicate that the smartphone-based algorithms may accurately detect four distinct patterns (braking, acceleration, left cornering and right cornering) with an average accuracy comparable to other popular detection approaches based on data collected using a fixed position device."

Furthermore, having information on infrastructure quality allows road managers to guarantee an adequate maintenance. These data can be given and used at the same time by users, by means of mobile devices, widespread in Italy and in the World. The main aim of this paper is to realize a simple application, which can be installed on several devices (smartphone/tablet), that allows to use sensors piggybacked on them in order to monitor road surface quality. Experimental tests are carried out on urban roads of Calabria (Italy) to validate and test the mobile application. In particular, the accelerometer is used for detecting surface conditions, in terms of potholes and bumps. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is employed to know in real time the location of vehicles and of road surface anomalies. Five different devices were used, all placed in a test vehicle in three different placement conditions. For the validation process, only one device was used, completely bound in an utilitarian car. The algorithm developed to detect road bumps and potholes is based on the analysis of the acceleration signal in terms of high-energy events; three filters are applied on the original signal. Moreover, verification of the rate of false detections and undetected road anomalies is planned, using georeferenced photos that allow the correct localization on the map and the assessment of the correspondence between the elements, detected with the accelerometer, and real road conditions. The results obtained show that our application could be used as an useful automated sensing system for road quality."

abstract = "This paper describes the use of support vector machine (SVM) classifier for real-time terrain estimation to improve autonomous navigation of tracked mobile robots. Real-time terrain identification and terrain property estimation has been explored previously for application on a wide range of systems from planetary exploration rovers to commercial vehicles like cars and trucks. A majority of the existing methods rely on the use of dedicated sensors including vibration sensors, accelerometers, cameras, LIDAR, etc., which makes them susceptible to the failure modes of each of these sensors. This work proposes a method for real-time classification of different terrain types based on the state evolution of a ground robot, specifically the measured change in the pose of the robot for a known control input. By using a trained SVM to perform terrain estimation based on the collected state evolution data, the proposed method does not require dedicated sensing modalities solely for the terrain estimation. In addition, this method is generally applicable in all conditions where the robot can traverse. The training data was obtained from four different terrain conditions including vinyl flooring, asphalt, artificial turf, and grass–gravel, to train the SVM to perform terrain estimation. The proposed technique is validated using a skid-steer tracked robot over multiple simulated and real terrain transitions cases, where the response to control inputs is significantly affected by terrain characteristics. The results show that the proposed method provides greater than 80% accuracy in all cases, with fast detection of terrain transitions. The paper concludes with a detailed description on the application of real-time terrain estimation in improving autonomous navigation."

Conventional pattern recognition approaches have made tremendous progress in the past years. However, those methods often heavily rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, which could hinder their generalization performance. Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks. This paper surveys the recent advance of deep learning based sensor-based activity recognition. We summarize existing literature from three aspects: sensor modality, deep model, and application. We also present detailed insights on existing work and propose grand challenges for future research."

Gait event detection (GED) is an important aspect in identifying and interpret a user’s gait to assess gait abnormalities and design intelligent assistive devices.
Research question
There is a need to develop robust GED models that can accurately detect various gait instances in different scenarios and environments.
Methods
This paper presents a novel method of detecting heel strikes (HS) and toe offs (TO) during the user’s gait cycle using a modified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks approach. The method was tested on a database from Movement Analysis in Real-world Environments using Accelerometers (MAREA) (n = 20 healthy subjects) that consisted of walking and running in indoor and outdoor environments with accelerometers positioned on waist, wrist and both ankles. Modifications include oversampling, composite accelerations and optimizing the LSTM network architecture were made.
Results
Performance of our modified model was found to be better than six state-of-the-art GED algorithms, with a median F1 score of 0.98 for Heel Strikes and 0.98 for Toe Offs in the scenario of steady walking in an indoor environment, and a median F1 score of 0.94 for Heel Strikes and 0.68 for Toe-offs in the scenario of walking and running in an outdoor environment.
Significance
This paper highlights the potential of the single proposed model to be an alternative to the six GED models in gait detection under various conditions."

abstract = "Background
Running is a popular physical activity that benefits health; however, running surface characteristics may influence loading impact and injury risk. Machine learning algorithms could automatically identify running surface from wearable motion sensors to quantify running exposures, and perhaps loading and injury risk for a runner.
Research question
(1) How accurately can machine learning algorithms identify surface type from three-dimensional accelerometer sensors? (2) Does the sensor count (single or two-sensor setup) affect model accuracy?
Methods
Twenty-nine healthy adults (23.3 ± 3.6 years, 1.8 ± 0.1 m, and 63.6 ± 8.5 kg) participated in this study. Participants ran on three different surfaces (concrete, synthetic, woodchip) while fit with two three-dimensional accelerometers (lower-back and right tibia). Summary features (n = 208) were extracted from the accelerometer signals. Feature-based Gradient Boosting (GB) and signal-based deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed. Models were trained on 90% of the data and tested on the remaining 10%. The process was repeated five times, with data randomly shuffled between train-test splits, to quantify model performance variability.
Results
All models and configurations achieved greater than 90% average accuracy. The highest performing models were the two-sensor GB and tibia-sensor CNN (average accuracy of 97.0 ± 0.7 and 96.1 ± 2.6%, respectively).
Significance
Machine learning algorithms trained on running data from a single- or dual-sensor accelerometer setup can accurately distinguish between surfaces types. Automatic identification of surfaces encountered during running activities could help runners and coaches better monitor training load, improve performance, and reduce injury rates."

abstract = "Most modern smartphones have a variety of built-in sensors, as an accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, proximity and a magnetic sensor. The large variety of sensors makes these devices powerful measurement tools, allowing the emergence of new systems and applications. In this paper, is presented a real data stream application related to asphalt pavement evaluation using acceleration data gathered by the accelerometer sensor of smartphones. The quality of the pavement has a significant influence on the final price of goods and services, the safety of drivers, pedestrians and passengers, and driver’s comfort. Thus, it is essential the use of tools, as proposed in this work, that allows the constant monitoring of pavement conditions by the Government authorities or private entities for more precise interventions in the maintenance planning with fewer expenses. This task is mainly important in developing countries where there is a lack of technology and a reduced budget for maintenance. Due to the popularity of smartphones, this tool can make possible that different users help to monitor the pavement quality ubiquitously during driving periods without effort. The application of asphalt evaluation is modeled in this work as a multi-dimensional time series classification problem, where the time series are the data from the three-axis accelerometer sensor. Given the characteristics of the data, we discuss and propose the combination of some classical distance measure for time series as Dynamic Time Warping or Longest Common Subsequence Similarity with the Complexity Invariant Distance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation was performed on three datasets that represent different scenarios of asphalt pavement classification. The proposed approach reaches a classification accuracy of 80\% to 98\% in the three evaluated problems and we experimentally show that the complexity invariance substantially improves the results achieved by classical distance measures given our classification tasks."

Mostly roads contain potholes, wreckage or detritus which is best to be bypassed however if not sometimes lead to severe road causalities. Many car or bus accident happens over a wrecked bridge, as it slips and overturns. To avoid this kind of mishap and improve the safety of the road we have proposed a machine learning based model, MagTrack, to detect these road conditions and inform apriori to the responsible authority for fast reparation as well as other passers-by to drive carefully or take an alternative route. We have collected various road surface conditions such as smooth roads, uneven roads, potholes, speed breakers, and rumble strips data using magnetometer and accelerometer sensor embedded in our Smartphone and analyzed using various classification algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Random Tree (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

abstract = {Smartphone-based applications for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become a real possibility because of the sensing and computing capabilities of these devices. In this work we employ smartphones' accelerometers to sense the quality of roads, detecting the perturbations encountered by the vehicle. The ultimate goal of this line of work is to correctly identify, classify and georeference all obstacles so alleviating measures can be taken. Having a continuous series of accelerometer readings, the first problem is to identify when a perturbation was sensed (segmentation). To approach this problem, we propose using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), obtaining an accuracy of about 82\%, outperforming other ad-hoc techniques such as Simple Mobile Average (SMA) and four other competitors. After segmentation, the next problem is to classify the event in one out of four different categories. To this end, we apply a Bag of Words representation and a Random Forest (RF), obtaining an accuracy of about 75\%. These results were obtained by exhaustively training and testing this classifier over a newly created dataset that comprises signals for 30 different roads. Altogether, the use of a SVM followed by a RF seems to be a viable option to create a pipeline to automatically recognize and identify Roadway Surface Disruptions.},

abstract = "Existing smartphone-based systems for detection of road surface events such as speed-breakers, potholes, broken road patches, etc. have been developed primarily for the use in four-wheeler vehicles such as cars with perfect driving maneuvers over a road with occasional irregularities. However, our experiments on a 673 km road trail in a suburban city of India, where an overall road condition is poor, show that such event detection accuracy drops to less than 80\% for speed-breakers and less than 70\% for potholes, when the crowdsourcing data is collected from different vehicles such as two-wheeler (bike or scooty), three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) or four-wheeler (car) or with different smartphones kept at different positions (in-pocket, in-dashboard, vehicle-mounted). The aim of this work is to develop a system that detects three road events — speed-breakers, potholes and broken road patches, with improved accuracy even under varying conditions and rough roads. The proposed RoadSurP system works in two phases. The first phase runs in a smartphone and identifies the candidate signatures for road anomalies using robust auto-orientation and auto-tune thresholding algorithms to make it almost invariant of position, placement, vehicle, and smartphone type. The second phase works in a server and uses a decision tree based classifier to reduce the false-negative and false-positive instances caused due to the impact of different driving maneuvers, vehicle suspensions, etc. Finally, we apply a k-medoids clustering to geo-localize detected events from multiple trails over a map service. RoadSurP is implemented as an Android application, and tested over a 26 km road using five two-wheeler, seven three-wheeler and three four-wheeler vehicles with six different smartphone types under varying placement and position of the smartphones. After being thoroughly trained, the mean accuracy of RoadSurP is found to be 98\% for speed-breakers and 92\% for potholes over a smooth road (a road with occasional irregularities) and 92\% for speed-breakers and 90\% for potholes over the rough road. The developed application can be used as an effective crowdsourcing system for road quality monitoring."

abstract = "In the inhabited zones where a large number of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users are expected, like school zones, it is necessary to decrease the speed to such a level that the risk of vulnerability is the lowest possible. One of the commonly accepted and often implemented speed decrease measures is vertical raising of the road pavement (speed bumps, speed humps, etc.). This work shows the influence of speed bumps of different heights (3, 5 and 7cm) to the decrease of vehicle speed. Speed measurements had been done before speed bumps were installed, 1day and 1month after the installation. Applying ANOVA analysis and post hoc analysis, using Tukey–Kramer’s multiple comparison test, a comparison was made of mean, 50th percentile and 85th percentile speed, before and after speed bumps setting. It has been shown that there is a significant speed decrease on the places where speed bumps were set, compared to the period before setting. Based on the research results, it was suggested that on the locations where vulnerable road users are extremely endangered, speed bumps 5 and 7cm high should be set, whereas at less endangered locations speed bumps 3cm high could be set. Also, it has been shown that the effects of speed bumps on speed decrease are enduring, because there has not been any significant deviation in vehicle speeds neither 1day nor 1month after speed bumps setting."
